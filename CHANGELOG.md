# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Because this is a GitHub Action rather than a library, "breaking" means a change
that would alter what appears in your README or require editing your workflow.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.14.1] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- **Stale league counts in the docs.** The README claimed 39 supported leagues and the
  action description claimed 30, while the registry held 41 — the `action.yml` number had
  been wrong for several releases, because nothing checked the prose. Both now read 41,
  and a test asserts every "`<n>` leagues" claim in the README and the action metadata
  matches the registry, so the numbers can't drift from the code again.

## [1.14.0] - 2026-09-19

### Added

- **Player spotlight for college basketball**: `player:` now works with `sport: ncaab`
  and `sport: ncaaw`. ESPN began serving the same `avgPoints`/`avgRebounds`/`avgAssists`
  splits payload and game log the NBA and WNBA use, so those boards show the player's
  season averages, most recent game, and headshot like the other basketball boards. Both
  leagues come off the "leagues without player spotlight" list, which now holds eight.
- **NASCAR Cup Series** (`nascar`) and **IndyCar Series** (`indycar`). Both rank drivers
  rather than teams, so `team:` takes a driver abbreviation and the board shows that
  driver's championship position and points — the same shape as the Formula 1 constructor
  board. ESPN publishes no driver abbreviations, so the rosters (top 30 of each
  championship) use surname-derived codes such as `HAM` for Denny Hamlin and `PAL` for
  Alex Palou, and both leagues appear in the player directory. The supported-league count
  is now 41.

### Fixed

- **The WNBA and G League sample boards drifted every day.** Both built their demo dates
  from `Date.now()` instead of the pinned demo clock, so `npm run examples:generate`
  rewrote `examples/wnba-min-napheesa-collier.md` on every run and the committed example
  could never match a fresh generation. Demo dates now come from `dateOffset()`, and the
  WNBA sample season is pinned the way the NBA's already was. The determinism test now
  derives a case from **every** supported league and freezes the clock with fake timers —
  the previous guard only covered a hand-listed set, which is why this went unnoticed.

## [1.13.1] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- **Formula 1's newest constructors** rendered with no championship position and
  0 points. ESPN publishes no abbreviation for Audi and Cadillac, and the
  constructor-standings lookup matched on abbreviation alone, so it never found
  them. The lookup now matches on the constructor's ESPN team id first and falls
  back to the abbreviation for entries that only carry one. Audi correctly shows
  P8 on 17 points, and Cadillac P11.
- **Player-spotlight documentation**: the "Leagues without player spotlight" list
  claimed six leagues while listing eight, and grouped Formula 1 with the
  individual-athlete tours. Formula 1 tracks constructors, so it now has its own
  row, the count is right, and the lookup guidance no longer sends Formula 1 users
  to the player directory. New tests keep the README list, the generated
  directories, and the validation allow-list from drifting apart again.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added

- **Five new soccer leagues**, all with live standings, schedules, and full team
  rosters verified against ESPN's public API:
  - **Greek Super League** (`greek`) — 14 clubs
  - **Austrian Bundesliga** (`austria`) — 12 clubs
  - **Danish Superliga** (`denmark`) — 12 clubs
  - **Norwegian Eliteserien** (`norway`) — 16 clubs
  - **Swedish Allsvenskan** (`sweden`) — 16 clubs

  The supported-league count is now 39. All five reuse the shared soccer base
  class, so they get records, points, conference standings, the next fixture,
  recent results, and the `player:` spotlight along with the other soccer
  leagues. Two clubs needed non-obvious team keys, because ESPN's own
  abbreviations are unusable as inputs: Austria Vienna and Rapid Vienna both
  report as `VIE`, so they are `AUS` and `RAP` here, and Örgryte's key is the
  ASCII `ORG` so it can be typed in a workflow.

### Fixed

- Player **headshots rendered at visibly different sizes between sports**. Each
  league serves its headshots at a different aspect ratio — ESPN's are 600×436
  landscape, MLB's are 213×320 portrait and the NHL's are 336×336 square — and
  the image was sized by width alone, so the rendered heights came out at 72×52,
  72×108 and 72×72. A spotlight from one sport was more than twice as tall as
  another's. The image is now sized by **height**, giving every sport the same
  vertical footprint; this also matches how the team logo was already sized.

## [1.12.1] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- **WNBA player spotlight**: the `player:` input now works for `sport: wnba`,
  showing the player's season averages (points/rebounds/assists per game), most
  recent game, and headshot. ESPN now serves WNBA athletes the same
  `avgPoints`/`avgRebounds`/`avgAssists` splits payload and game log that the
  NBA already uses, so the WNBA is no longer one of the leagues that can't
  support a spotlight. A new sample board (`examples/wnba-min-napheesa-collier.md`)
  demonstrates it.

### Changed

- Corrected the README's **"Leagues without player spotlight"** table: the WNBA
  was listed there with the reason "ESPN returns an empty stat payload and an
  empty game log for every athlete", which is no longer true. The remaining
  exclusions (`ncaab`, `ncaaw`, `ncaaf`, `gleague`, `ncaa_hockey`) are
  re-verified against the live APIs — their stats endpoints still 404 and their
  game logs are still empty.
- The `player` input description no longer claims support is limited to `nba`
  and `mlb`; it now lists every league that supports it.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- **Player headshots**: a player spotlight now shows the athlete's headshot,
  right-aligned beside the "Player Spotlight" heading, matching how the team
  logo sits beside the team board. The image is built from the athlete id the
  roster lookup already fetches, so it needs no extra request, no new input,
  and no configuration. Supported wherever `player:` is (NBA, MLB, NFL, NHL,
  and every soccer league). When the upstream feed has no athlete id the image
  is omitted and the board renders exactly as before, and `compact: true`
  stays text-only.

### Fixed

- Corrected several **demo roster athlete ids** that were wrong, which mattered
  once headshots were built from them: the NHL demo rosters pointed Panarin,
  McDavid, Draisaitl, Shesterkin, Fox, Kopitar, Kempe, Byfield, Larkin, Seider,
  Marchand, Swayman and Hyman at the wrong players (or at ids belonging to
  someone else), and the NFL demo roster reused a single id across two teams in
  four places (e.g. `Travis Kelce` and `CeeDee Lamb` shared one id). Every id
  is now verified against the live roster endpoint.
- Demo/gallery boards no longer show a record that contradicts the results
  printed beneath it. Previously the NFL sample board advertised a hardcoded
  `9W - 3L` season while its recent games were regenerated with `Math.random()`
  on every run, so the two could never agree and each run produced different
  output. Sample data is now derived from a seeded generator: it is identical on
  every run (so `npm run examples:generate` is reproducible), and the headline
  record is counted from the same full game log that the recent results are
  sliced from.
- The **Next** fixture on every sample board is no longer the same team that
  just appeared in **Recent Games**. The NFL demo listed "vs SF" as both the
  latest result and the upcoming game; leagues with only two or three demo teams
  (EPL, MLS, UCL, La Liga, NCAAF) had no unused opponent at all, so they now
  draw from a padded per-sport opponent pool.
- Player Spotlight **Last Game** dates now match the team board's most recent
  game on every sample board. The NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL and soccer spotlights
  previously used their own offset date, so the same fixture appeared with two
  different dates (or the wrong opponent) in one board.
- The NFL demo no longer returns raw game-log objects to the renderer, which
  produced `Invalid Date` and blank scores. All adapters now emit the same
  renderer-ready game shape.
- Dates are formatted consistently whether a feed supplies a calendar date
  (`2026-09-15`) or a full ISO timestamp. The NFL and MLB renderers appended
  `T12:00:00` unconditionally, which turned a valid timestamp into
  `Invalid Date`.
- The NBA sample board now includes per-game scores and outcomes. Its mapping
  dropped `teamScore`/`oppScore`/`won`, so recent games rendered without scores.
- The NFL **Standing** label now reads `AFC`/`NFC` instead of the raw ESPN group
  name (`American Football`), matching the abbreviation used elsewhere on the
  board.
- Washington is accepted as both `WSH` (ESPN's abbreviation) and `WAS` (the
  previous alias), so `team: WSH` no longer fails validation.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- MLB player spotlight support for the `player:` input. You can now feature a
  batter's season line and last game alongside an MLB team board, e.g.
  `player: "Vladimir Guerrero Jr."` with `sport: mlb` and `team: TOR`. The
  spotlight shows the season batting average, home runs, and RBIs, plus the
  player's last game (hits, home runs, RBIs, batting average, opponent, and
  date). The Blue Jays demo board now includes Vladimir Guerrero Jr.

### Fixed

- The ATP and WTA **Last Match** fields no longer show an upcoming (scheduled)
  match as a played result. ESPN's athlete competitions endpoint returns the
  player's most recent competition, which can be a future opponent with no
  result yet. The adapters now only report the most recent match that has
  actually been played (a determined winner or a `completed` status), so a
  scheduled opponent isn't rendered with a fake score.

## [1.11.1] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- The MLB player spotlight **Last Game** now reports the player's most recent
  game. The MLB Stats API returns the game log in chronological order (oldest
  first), so the last game is the final entry, not the first one — previously
  the season opener was shown instead of the latest result (e.g. Mar 27 instead
  of Sep 7 for Vladimir Guerrero Jr.).

## [1.10.4] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- The NBA player spotlight **Last Game** date was rendered in UTC, which shifted
  late-night games to the wrong day (e.g. a game on Apr 2 showed as Apr 3). It's
  now rendered in the league's timezone (`America/New_York`) so the date shows
  the actual calendar day the game was played.

## [1.10.3] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- The NBA player spotlight's **Last Game** line now also shows the opponent and
  the game date (e.g. `26 PTS · 4 REB · 7 AST · 34 MIN vs Minnesota
  Timberwolves (Sep 4, 2026)`), fetched from the event summary and rendered in
  UTC so the date doesn't shift across timezones.

### Changed

- Corrected the NBA player spotlight docs example to use the player's exact
  live-roster spelling (`Luka Doncic`, no diacritic), and clarified that the
  match must mirror ESPN's exact spelling.

## [1.10.2] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- The **NBA player spotlight** `player:` input was not being passed to the
  action runtime: `action.yml` defined the input but never exported it to the
  `PLAYER` environment variable, so the spotlight silently never rendered. The
  env block now maps `PLAYER` to `inputs.player`.

## [1.10.1] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- **Player spotlight (NBA)**: a new `player:` input shows a specific player's season averages (points/rebounds/assists per game) and most recent game's box score alongside an NBA team board. NBA-only for now; other team sports are planned as follow-ups.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- **Three new soccer leagues**: A-League Men (Australia), Indian Super League,
  and Chinese Super League, all with live standings, schedules, and full
  team rosters verified against ESPN's public API.
- **NFL standings**: the NFL board now shows the team's conference **standing**
  and **next game**, matching the other team leagues. The adapter fetches the
  ESPN NFL standings endpoint for the conference rank and reads the next
  non-final game from the schedule.
- **League showcase**: `examples/leagues/` now has one file per supported
  league, built from live data, demonstrating the default board plus the
  `title:`, `compact:`, and `badge:` options in one place. Run
  `npm run leagues:showcase` to regenerate it; a new daily workflow
  (`update-league-showcase.yml`) does this automatically and opens a PR when
  live data changes the output.
- **WTA Tennis**: added as a new individual-athlete league (`sport: wta`),
  mirroring the existing ATP Tennis board — world ranking, ranking points,
  movement, and the player's most recent match result. Both the ATP and WTA
  rosters cover the top 30 singles ranking, each with a country flag emoji.
- **Player directory columns**: `PLAYER_DIRECTORY.md` / `player-directory.json`
  now include each player's country **flag**, **country name**, and live
  **rank**/**points** from their tour's current rankings, refreshed daily by
  the existing directory workflow.

### Fixed

- **F1 entity classification**: Formula 1 tracks constructors (Ferrari,
  Mercedes, Red Bull, ...), not individual drivers, so it was incorrectly
  tagged as an individual-athlete league. It's now classified as a team
  sport and listed in the team directory instead of the player directory.
- **Team directory leak**: individual-athlete leagues (ATP, WTA) no longer
  appear in `team-directory.json` / `TEAM_DIRECTORY.md` — their rosters live
  solely in `player-directory.json` / `PLAYER_DIRECTORY.md`.
- **Broken README anchors**: the "Team & Player Abbreviations" table-of-contents
  link and the profile-example link now point at the correct sections.

## [1.9.3] - 2026-09-02

### Changed

- The **standing** and **next-game** lines on team boards (basketball,
  baseball, football, hockey, soccer) now render on their own row, separated
  from the conference/season paragraph, so they read clearly instead of
  wrapping awkwardly into the season status.

## [1.9.2] - 2026-09-01

### Changed

- The ATP board's **Last Match** result now renders in its own fenced block,
  mirroring the recent-games blocks on other boards, so it no longer merges
  into the ranking meta line.
- The generated **team directory** now resolves real team names (e.g. "Atlanta
  Hawks") instead of abbreviation-only names for leagues whose static registry
  lacked embedded names, so team lookups show full names.

## [1.9.1] - 2026-09-01

### Changed

- Improved the ATP tennis board's readability: the world ranking, ranking
  points, and movement are now grouped on a single line, and the latest match
  result gets its own labeled **Last Match** line instead of being buried in
  the ranking info.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- **Entity typing**: sports now declare whether they track a `team` or a
  `player`. Individual sports like **ATP Tennis** and **Formula 1** default to
  `player`, so boards read "My Favourite ATP Tennis Player" and validations say
  "player abbreviation". The `entity` input lets you override the inferred type.
- **ATP Tennis** support: an individual-sport board showing a ranked player's
  world ranking, ranking points, movement, and most recent match result. A new
  `atp` adapter reads the free ESPN ATP rankings endpoint and the player's
  latest competition (opponent, result, set scores), and a new `renderAtp`
  renders the board.

### Changed

- Added a generated **player directory** ([PLAYER_DIRECTORY.md](PLAYER_DIRECTORY.md)
  and its machine-readable [`player-directory.json`](player-directory.json)),
  mirroring the team directory for individual sports. It lists player
  abbreviations, names, and IDs so individual-sport boards (ATP) can be looked
  up the same way team boards use the team directory. The daily directory
  refresh workflow regenerates it alongside the team directory.
- Removed the huge per-league team abbreviation tables from the README. The
  generated [team directory](TEAM_DIRECTORY.md) is now the single source of
  truth for team names, abbreviations, and IDs, so the README no longer
  duplicates each league's roster inline (README shrank from ~2000 to ~550
  lines). The college roster automation workflow and scripts were retired in
  favor of the daily team-directory refresh.

## [1.8.2] - 2026-08-30

### Added

- **Argentine Primera** support: a new `argentina` soccer adapter reusing the
  shared soccer base (single-table standings, record, and richer stats).
- Expanded the [examples gallery](examples/): boards for MLB, UEFA Champions
  League, College Football, and Formula 1, plus demos of the `title:`, `teams:`
  (multi-team), `compact:`, and `badge:` options.

### Changed

- The generated [team directory](TEAM_DIRECTORY.md) now pulls the **complete**
  live roster for collegiate and UEFA tournament leagues, so it no longer shows
  just the handful of hardcoded teams.
- Removed the redundant last-five `🔥 Form:` line from the board: the Recent
  Games list already shows the W/L/D sequence.
- Fixed the MLB "next game" showing a stale postponed game (e.g. "Apr 3") by
  fetching the upcoming schedule and only treating genuinely future games as
  the next opponent.
- Corrected the supported-league count to 29.
- The README GitHub Marketplace badge and install line now point at the
  repository; a tip explains how to publish the action so the Marketplace
  listing appears.
- Added the required `author` field to `action.yml` so the action can be
  published to the GitHub Marketplace.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed

- Repaired the invalid `action.yml` YAML that broke opening the action. The
  composite `env:` block had over-indented `TEAMS`/`TITLE`/`BADGE` mappings and
  was missing `MARKER`/`TARGET_REPO`/`DRY_RUN`/`COMPACT`, so the GitHub Actions
  manifest loader rejected the action. All 10 env mappings now sit at a
  consistent level.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- **Formula 1** support: constructor championship position and points on the
  board via a new `f1` adapter and renderer.
- Extended the richer board output (standing position, next game, last-five
  form) to the remaining leagues: WNBA, NBA G League, MLB, and NHL.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- Generated examples gallery under `examples/` (with `npm run examples:generate`)
  and a `SUPPORT.md` getting-help guide.
- GitHub Marketplace, stars, and forks badges plus a Marketplace/Discussions
  callout at the top of the README.
- A "30-second setup" quick-start box and a "Customizing the board" section
  documenting `compact` and `dry_run`.
- `teams:` input to render multiple scoreboards in a single action run.
- `title:` input to customize the scoreboard heading.
- `badge:` input to render shields-style badges instead of a full block.
- Richer board output: league/standing position, the next scheduled game, and
  last-five form (W/D/L), shown for supported leagues.

### Fixed

- Team-directory generation no longer writes `null` team names when a live
  name lookup fails or omits a name; it falls back to demo data and finally the
  abbreviation so the generated directory never shows an empty cell.

### Changed

- `action.yml` input descriptions clarified (team, token, marker, target repo).
- README team-abbreviation section links to the generated `TEAM_DIRECTORY.md`
  as the single searchable source of truth.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- Live dry-run mode, step outputs, and workflow-dispatch inputs for easier
  testing and automation.
- Daily API and season-date verification, including regular-season opening-date
  checks for supported leagues.

### Changed

- README examples now target the versioned `@v1` action release and document
  fine-grained token permissions.
- Maintenance updates use strict live-date checks, serialized branches, safe
  fetches, and bounded workflow runtimes.

### Fixed

- League logos, heading alt text, and season-year rollover handling across the
  generated README output.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- All-adapter demo smoke tests and a scheduled API health check workflow.
- `npm run doctor` for local configuration and connectivity diagnostics.
- GitHub Actions step summaries for generated README output and run results.

### Changed

- Shared API requests now use bounded timeouts and retries across adapters and
  maintenance scripts.
- Action inputs are validated before a run can modify a README.
- Maintenance workflows serialize updates to avoid competing README changes.

### Fixed

- README league headings and registry links are checked for complete logos,
  accessible alt text, and supported endpoints.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- Weekly automation for refreshing NCAA team abbreviation tables from ESPN.
- Safer README update retries and serialized maintenance workflows.

### Changed

- Action metadata now documents every supported league and installs production
  dependencies with the locked package file.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-08-14

Five new leagues, and the generated block now includes its own section heading.

### Added

- **Primeira Liga** (`primeiraliga`) — 18 clubs ([#61])
- **Eredivisie** (`eredivisie`) — 18 clubs ([#66])
- **WNBA** (`wnba`) — 15 teams, the first non-soccer league since the NBA and the
  first women's league. Standalone adapter: single-year season, conferences but
  no divisions, and playoff tagging via a separate schedule fetch ([#67])
- **Liga MX** (`ligamx`) — 18 clubs. Plays two 17-match tournaments a year
  (Apertura and Clausura), so the season label stays within one calendar year and
  the standings group names the current tournament ([#68])
- **Brasileirão** (`brasileirao`) — 20 clubs ([#69])
- The section heading (`## My Favourite <League> Team`, with the league logo) is
  now rendered **inside** the marker block, so the whole section is generated
  rather than half-authored by hand ([#65])

### Fixed

- The NHL entry in the Supported Sports table linked to a URL that returned
  **404**. Every league now links to an endpoint that returns real data ([#70])
- The Supported Sports table linked "ESPN API" to the ESPN homepage 13 times;
  it now shows each league's actual endpoint path ([#70])

### Documentation

- Explained that **each sport needs its own marker pair**. Two sports sharing one
  pair caused the second to silently overwrite the first, with no error ([#62])
- Added the missing `marker` input to the MLB, NFL, NHL and Quick Start examples,
  which previously demonstrated the overwrite bug they now warn about ([#63])

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- **Premier League** (`epl`) — 20 clubs, with W/L/D records, points (W×3 + D) and
  draws marked 🟡 ([#51])
- `BaseSoccerAdapter`, shared by every soccer league. MLS dropped to a 39-line
  data file, and each new league since has been roughly 35 lines ([#51])
- League logos in the README section headings and the sports table ([#52])

### Fixed

- **Team logos were broken across four of five sports.** The NBA CDN returned 403
  for all 30 teams, MLB's `.png` path 404'd for all 30, several MLS clubs pointed
  at other clubs' crests, and three NHL abbreviations (`NJ`, `SJ`, `TB`) don't
  match the CDN's spelling. All now verified working ([#48], [#49])
- Off-season status reported next season a year late on the eve of kickoff — it
  compared only the month, so Aug 8 with an Aug 10 start read "August 2027" ([#51])

### Changed

- Logo construction moved out of `index.js` into a `getLogoUrl()` on each adapter,
  so per-sport quirks live with the sport that owns them ([#49])

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- **MLS** (`mls`), including draw handling — the first sport where a game can end
  in neither a win nor a loss
- `[Playoffs]` tag on postseason games, across all sports
- Season status line (🟢 in progress / 🔴 off-season with the next start date)
- Year included in recent-game dates

### Changed

- **NBA moved from BallDontLie to ESPN's free API, removing the last API key.**
  Every sport now uses a free, no-auth source, and the `api_key` action input is
  gone

### Fixed

- NBA season label used the wrong year — ESPN's season number is the *end* year
- MLB records read from the standings API rather than counted game by game, which
  had missed doubleheaders
- NHL off-season detection now falls back to the previous season
- Pre-season games excluded, playoff games included, across all sports

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-31

Initial release.

### Added

- NBA, MLB, NFL and NHL scoreboards, written between HTML comment markers in your
  profile README
- `marker` input, so multiple scoreboards can live in one README
- Team abbreviation tables and demo mode (`--demo`)
